Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll share thoughts on technology, building products, and the founder journey.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Tech**: Deep dives into interesting technical problems
- **Building**: Lessons learned from shipping products
- **Founder Reflections**: The ups and downs of the startup life

## Why write?

Writing helps me think more clearly. It forces me to organize my thoughts and articulate ideas that might otherwise stay fuzzy in my head.

Plus, if even one person finds something useful here, that's a win.

Stay tuned for more posts!
