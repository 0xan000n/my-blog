## Why I invested

dLogos is building the market network for dialogue. Right now, the demand for meaningful conversations is scattered across DMs, polls, tweets, and comments. Hosts can't parse signal from noise. Fans have no real way to coordinate around the guests and topics they want. Speakers don't know where authentic demand exists. Sponsors can't find values-aligned cultural moments.

dLogos connects all these nodes into a single coordination layer where fans, speakers, hosts, beneficiaries, and sponsors can transact around conversations that matter.

## The thesis

Great civilizations were built on dialogue. dLogos is restoring that infrastructure for the digital age.

There's real economic energy during zeitgeist moments. When cultural attention converges around a topic or figure, audiences act. The COVID vaccine debate between Dr. Peter Hotez and RFK Jr. on Joe Rogan generated $2.6M+ in committed pledges. Eric Weinstein x Vivek Ramaswamy on H-1B visas hit 2M+ views. The demand exists. What's missing is the coordination layer to capture and direct it.

## What excites me

1. **Clear pain point** - Hosts can't parse signal from noise, fans can't influence what gets made
2. **Multiple revenue streams** - 5% platform fee, sponsorships, pay-to-promote, SaaS tier for hosts
3. **Zeitgeist-first GTM** - AI-augmented tools to launch campaigns within 24-48 hours of cultural moments
4. **Web3 native** - On-chain reputation and micro-pledging with transparent, trustless proof of impact
5. **Timing** - The Overton window is reopening toward nuance and dialogue as civic virtue
