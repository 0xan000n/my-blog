## Why I invested

When I first met the founders of Example Climate Co, I was struck by their deep technical expertise and obsessive focus on the problem. They had spent years in the industry and understood the nuances that most founders miss.

## The thesis

Climate tech is at an inflection point. The unit economics of carbon capture have improved dramatically over the past few years, and regulatory tailwinds are stronger than ever. This team has a differentiated approach that could be 10x more efficient than existing solutions.

## What excites me

1. **Technical moat** - Their proprietary process is protected by multiple patents
2. **Team** - Former heads of engineering at major industrial companies
3. **Timing** - Regulatory environment has never been more favorable
4. **Early traction** - Already piloting with two Fortune 500 companies

## How I'm helping

- Introduced them to potential enterprise customers in my network
- Advising on go-to-market strategy for industrial sales
- Connected them with follow-on investors for their Series A
