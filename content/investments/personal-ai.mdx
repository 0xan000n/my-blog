## Why I invested

Personal AI is tackling one of the most fundamental human challenges: memory. We forget about 80% of information within three days, and our knowledge remains locked in our minds, inaccessible to others. The founding team (Suman Kanuganti, Sharon Zhang, and Kristie Kaiser) have a clear vision: build an AI for each individual to augment human biological memory.

What drew me in was their quote: "You don't solve the human, you solve the problem." They're not trying to enhance brains surgically or chemically. They're building tools that solve the memory problem externally.

## The thesis

Personal AI represents a fundamental shift from centralized, corporate-owned AI to personalized, user-owned models. Their thesis rests on three pillars:

1. **Decentralization of ownership** - Self-sovereignty of data through Web 3.0 principles, giving individuals control over their identity and personal AI
2. **Decentralization of AI** - Personal Language Models (PLMs) trained on individual data, eliminating the bias inherent in aggregated models
3. **Decentralization of economy** - Tokenization frameworks that let individuals monetize their own AIs for their economic benefit

## What excites me

1. **Personal Language Models** - Each user gets their own 120M parameter model trained entirely on their memories, not a shared LLM
2. **User ownership** - Your Personal AI is owned and managed by you, never sold
3. **Proven retention** - 35% Day 30 retention for users with 100+ memories, 52% for 1,000+ memories—above a16z's "Great" benchmark
4. **Capital efficiency** - 80%+ profit margin per subscriber, up to 40x more cost effective than LLM-based systems
5. **Founding team** - Four successful exits totaling over $20B combined

The future of AI is personal.
