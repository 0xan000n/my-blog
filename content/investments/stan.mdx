## Why I invested

STAN is building what Discord and Twitch should have been for mobile-first markets. In India and other emerging regions, gaming happens on phones, not PCs. The existing platforms weren't designed for that reality.

Parth Chadha and the team saw this gap clearly. They built voice-led "Clubs," live-game integrations, and monetization tools (shoutouts, subscriptions, brand activations) that actually work on mobile. Over 25 million downloads prove the demand is real.

## The thesis

Gaming is no longer just play. It's identity, conversation, and community. STAN is transforming gameplay into a social layer rather than a content stream. For Gen Z in emerging markets, this is how they hang out.

The mobile-first architecture and creator-centric business model position them well to become India's next major social platform.

## What excites me

1. **Mobile-native design** - Built specifically for how emerging markets actually game
2. **Strong traction** - 25M+ downloads, 25x growth in two years through product-led expansion
3. **Big backers** - Bandai Namco, Square Enix, Google AI Futures Fund, and Aptos Labs in their latest round
4. **Creator economics** - Real monetization tools that work, not just chat rooms
5. **AI personalization** - Using AI to match players with communities and content they'll love
