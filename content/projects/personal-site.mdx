## Why I built this

I wanted a simple, fast, personal website where I could share my thoughts and projects. No complex CMS, no heavy frameworks—just markdown files and clean code.

## The stack

### Next.js 15 with App Router

The App Router gives us React Server Components by default, which means almost zero client-side JavaScript. Pages load instantly.

### Tailwind CSS v4

Utility-first CSS that makes styling fast and consistent. Dark mode is built in with the class strategy.

### MDX for content

Write in markdown, but with the power of React components when needed. Perfect for technical writing.

### Deployed on Vercel

Zero-config deployment. Push to main, and it's live.

## Performance goals

- **LCP < 1s**: Achieved through SSG and optimized images
- **CLS = 0**: All images have explicit dimensions
- **INP < 50ms**: Minimal client JavaScript

## Key features

1. **Cypherpunk animated text** - A fun decrypt effect on the homepage
2. **Server-side category filtering** - No client JS needed for filtering blog posts
3. **Dark mode without flash** - Inline script sets theme before paint
4. **Mobile-first design** - Responsive with 44px touch targets

## Lessons learned

Keep it simple. It's tempting to add features, but every feature has a maintenance cost. Start minimal and add only what you need.
