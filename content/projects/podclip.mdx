excerpt: "How I built a full-stack AI-powered podcast clip extractor in 3 days with Claude Code—from script to production web app with real-time progress, LLM orchestration, and professional video processing."
---

## The Problem

Podcast creators want to go viral on TikTok, Reels, and Shorts. But manually finding clip-worthy moments in 2-hour episodes is tedious.

**The vision:** Paste a YouTube URL, and 10 minutes later get 5 AI-selected viral clips with hooks, captions, and timestamps ready to post.

**The result:** Built in 3 days with Claude Opus 4.6 (via Claude Code CLI). Production-ready full-stack app with LLM orchestration, real-time progress, and professional video processing.

---

## From Script to System

I started with a working Python script (`pod-clipper`) that processed podcasts locally. It worked, but had no web interface, no async operations, global config everywhere, no progress visibility, and no database.

**My prompt to Claude:**
> "Help me turn this podcast clipper script into a production web app. I want:
> - FastAPI backend with async/await
> - Next.js frontend with real-time progress
> - Database to store jobs and clips
> - Clean architecture (no global state)"

Claude analyzed the codebase and proposed:

```
Backend (FastAPI + SQLite + Async)
  ↓
Pipeline Modules (Refactored from pod-clipper)
  ↓
Background Jobs (asyncio.to_thread)
  ↓
Real-time Progress (SSE)
  ↓
Frontend (Next.js + shadcn/ui)
```

### Key Decisions

**SSE over WebSocket** for real-time progress:
- Simpler protocol (no connection upgrade)
- Browser-native EventSource API
- Falls back to polling gracefully

**Async Bridge Pattern** to solve CPU-bound blocking:
```python
class ProgressReporter:
    def report(self, status, pct, message):
        # Called from blocking thread
        self._events.append(event)
        self._loop.call_soon_threadsafe(self._async_event.set)

    async def listen(self):
        # Async generator for SSE
        while True:
            await self._async_event.wait()
            yield event
```

This lets FFmpeg and LLM operations run in threads while the web server streams progress in real-time.

## Two-Phase LLM Strategy

Sending entire 2-hour transcripts to Claude was expensive and overwhelming. Claude designed a two-phase pipeline:

**Phase 1: Triage (Sonnet - fast scan)**
- Scans full transcript → Top 20 candidates
- Priority score, category, timestamps
- ~$0.10 per video

**Phase 2: Deep Analysis (Opus - focused)**
- Analyzes small windows around promising moments
- Generates virality scores, hooks, quotes, scroll-stoppers, captions
- ~$0.50 per video

Total LLM cost: **~$0.60 per video**

### The 219-Line Prompt

The `DETECTION_PROMPT` teaches semantic boundaries:

```
CRITICAL: Your start_time and end_time should land on NATURAL SENTENCE BOUNDARIES
  - Start just before the speaker begins the key thought (not mid-sentence)
  - End just after they complete the thought (not mid-word or mid-sentence)
  - A 10-second buffer will be added automatically before and after your timestamps
  - Your timestamps should capture the ESSENTIAL content; the buffer prevents cutoffs
```

Combined with post-processing buffer, clips never cut off mid-sentence.

---

## The FFmpeg Challenge

Naive approach had seeking issues, codec errors, and random failures:
```bash
ffmpeg -ss START -i video.mp4 -t DURATION output.mp4  # ❌ Unreliable
```

**Claude's two-step solution:**

**Step 1:** Stream-copy segment (instant, no decoding)
```bash
ffmpeg -ss START -i video.mp4 -t DURATION -c copy segment.mp4
```

**Step 2:** Re-encode from segment (no seeking needed)
```bash
ffmpeg -i segment.mp4 [filters] -c:v libx264 output.mp4
```

Bypasses all codec issues. For TikTok/Reels, scales video to 9:16 with blurred background.

## Real-Time Progress

Before: Submit URL → black box → clips appear 10 minutes later

After: Live updates via SSE:
```
[████░░░░░░] 40% Analyzing transcript...
[████████░░] 80% Creating clips: 3/5
[██████████] 100% Complete!
```

Frontend polls `/api/jobs/{jobId}/clips` every 3 seconds during clip creation. Clips appear as they're generated, not after all are done.

---

## The Buffer Fix

After testing with real podcasts, clips cut off mid-sentence:
- "...and that's why I think—" [CUT]

**My prompt:**
> "New rule: clips should not cut off mid-sentence. Add 10s buffer before and after"

**Claude's hybrid solution:**
1. Updated prompts to teach LLM about natural boundaries
2. Applied post-processing buffer
3. Clamped to video duration

```python
buffered_start = max(0.0, start_time - buffer_before)  # 10s before
buffered_end = min(end_time + buffer_after, video_duration)  # 10s after
```

Result: Perfect clip boundaries. Implementation took 3 hours, 5 files modified.

## Tech Stack

### Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy Async

- FastAPI for async/await and SSE streaming
- SQLite via `aiosqlite` (single file, no server)
- Pydantic validation built-in

### Frontend: Next.js 16 + shadcn/ui

- Server Components for fast initial render
- Dynamic routing (`/jobs/[id]`)
- API proxy (`/api/*` → backend:8000)
- shadcn/ui for accessible components

### Pipeline: 6 Steps

```
1. Fetch metadata (yt-dlp)
2. Extract transcript (YouTube captions)
3. Detect highlights (Claude 2-phase)
4. Download video (yt-dlp)
5. Create clips (FFmpeg → Supabase)
6. Notify (Slack, Airtable)
```

## What Got Built

**Core:**
- YouTube download, transcript extraction, AI highlight detection
- Video clip creation (vertical or original)
- Cloud storage (Supabase S3)

**Interface:**
- URL submission, live progress, clip gallery
- Job detail pages, library browser

**Metadata:**
- Virality scores, hooks, quotes, energy levels
- Scroll-stoppers, interstitials, dual captions

**Production:**
- Docker, Railway deployment
- Error handling, migrations

**Performance:** 5-10 minutes for 2-hour podcast
- Metadata: ~2s
- Transcript: ~5s
- Highlights: ~2-3m (LLM)
- Download: ~1-2m
- Clips: ~2-3m (parallel)

## The Collaboration

**What I brought:**
- Domain knowledge (what makes clips viral)
- User requirements and testing
- Design constraints (shadcn/ui, no global state)

**What Claude brought:**
- Architecture patterns (SSE, async bridge, two-phase LLM)
- Code implementation with error handling
- Edge case discovery (bounds checking, codec issues)

**Key lesson:** Start with architecture, not code. Provide clear constraints ("Use shadcn/ui" > "make it look good"). Test with real data—Claude won't notice mid-sentence cutoffs until you report them.

**Memory system:** Claude Code maintained project patterns in `MEMORY.md`. When I started the buffer enhancement session 3 days later, it knew the project structure, referenced files by path, and followed existing patterns. No "what is this project?" conversation needed.

---

## Metrics

- **Time:** 12 hours (vs estimated 3-5 days solo)
- **Speedup:** 6-10x
- **Code:** 2,600 lines of production code
- **Stack:** 8 technologies seamlessly integrated
- **Cost:** $0.60 per video processed

**The shift:** Building with Claude Code changed my question from "Can I build this?" to "Should I build this?"

The limiting factor is no longer technical implementation—it's product vision and user understanding.
