excerpt: End-to-end automation system for a $XM+ ARR staffing and consulting company—from complete disorganization to a streamlined pipeline.
---

## The problem

A staffing and consulting company doing $XM+ ARR was manually handling their end-to-end recruitment pipeline. Candidate info was super chaotic and scattered across spreadsheets, manual job description parsing, email/LinkedIn outreach with no cohesive system to track pipeline stages. As a result, the team was drowning in busywork instead of closing deals.

## What I built

A fully automated system that handles the entire staffing workflow:

### Scrape job info w/ AI
Built a straightforward AI scraper on [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) that extracts requirements, qualifications, and keywords from job descriptions automatically. No more copying and pasting into spreadsheets.

### Source candidates automatically
Integrated [Metaview](https://www.metaview.ai/) and [Juicebox](https://juicebox.ai/?via=765bf9&utm_source=google&utm_medium=pmax&utm_campaign=pmax_remarketing&utm_content=&utm_term={searchterm}&hstk_creative=&hstk_campaign=23347676118&hstk_network=googleAds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23352796523&gbraid=0AAAAAo-1_snFEZsD2A1HpbOv0mdsN4Hpe) for automatic candidate sourcing. When a new role comes in, AI generates the key words to search for and automatically provides an optimal search query to run when looking for candidates.


### Drafts emails for outreach
AI generates *personalized* tailored outreach messages based on each candidate's profile, their experience, skills, and career trajectory.

### Automated email outreach
Candidates get personalized outreach emails triggered automatically based on role fit. Next todo: sequences to handle follow-ups without manual intervention.

### TODO: Improve with LinkedIn outreach
Parallel LinkedIn sequences should run alongside email. In an ideal scenario, connection requests and follow-up messages is automated while staying within platform limits.

### Airtable as the hub
Everything flows through Airtable as the central database - candidates, roles, pipeline stages, communications. One source of truth instead of scattered docs.

## The result

Went from complete disorganization to a proper, scalable system. The team can now spend time on high-value activities like closing new clients, relationship building with hiring managers.
