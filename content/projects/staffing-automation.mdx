## The problem

A staffing and consulting company doing $XM+ ARR was running on chaos. Candidate info scattered across spreadsheets, manual job description parsing, email outreach done one-by-one, no system to track pipeline stages. The team was drowning in busywork instead of closing deals.

## What I built

A fully automated system that handles the entire staffing workflow:

### Automatic candidate sourcing
Integrated Metaview and Juicebox for automatic candidate sourcing. When a new role comes in, the system pulls qualified candidates without manual searching.

### AI-powered job description scraping
Built an AI scraper that extracts requirements, qualifications, and keywords from job descriptions automatically. No more copying and pasting into spreadsheets.

### Personalized content creation
AI generates tailored outreach messages based on each candidate's profile—their experience, skills, and career trajectory. No more generic templates.

### Automated email outreach
Candidates get personalized outreach emails triggered automatically based on role fit. Sequences handle follow-ups without manual intervention.

### LinkedIn outreach automation
Parallel LinkedIn sequences run alongside email. Connection requests, follow-up messages, and engagement all automated while staying within platform limits.

### Airtable as the hub
Everything flows through Airtable as the central database—candidates, roles, pipeline stages, communications. One source of truth instead of scattered docs.

## The result

Went from complete disorganization to a proper system. The team now spends time on high-value activities (closing, relationship building) instead of manual data entry and outreach.
